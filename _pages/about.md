I am second-year undergraduate student from Huazhong University of Science and Technology. My research interest includes **Trustworthy Machine Learning**, especially the security and safety problems on Large Foundation Models.

I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Pan Zhou. Before joining HUST, I got my bachelor's degree in ECUST.
